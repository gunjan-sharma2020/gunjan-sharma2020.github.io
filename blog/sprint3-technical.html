    <h1>Questions and Answers</h1>
    <h2>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</h2>
  
    
    <h3>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h3>
    
    <P>HTML is like a house that we build with bricks, wood or any other material we use to give it a strong foundation and CSS is like decorating it and giving it some colour and design. 
      In short, CSS is interior decoration of your house.</P>

         <h3>Explain control flow and loops</h3>
         <h4>Loops</h4>
         <p>Loops are used to run a block of codes until a set of conditions are met. When you want the code to run over and over again with a different value then loop is used. 
           There are different types of loops ‘while loop’, ‘for loop’, ‘do… while’.</p>
           <p>We see loop in our everyday life. Similarly, in my life there are loops that I do everyday such as after waking up and brushing my teeth 
             I prepare kids lunch boxes and this loop continues until its week-end.</p>

         <h4>Control flow</h4>
         <p>‘If…. else’ statements are referred as control flow. These statements help a program meet the conditions to execute code.
            If one statement is true then then one block of code is executed. 
           If the statement is false then another block of code is executed. </p> 

           <p>One of the basic examples is: if a student clears the medical preliminary examination then 
             he/she will get the admission in the medical field else they will try in other departments</p>
    
         <h3>Describe what the DOM is</h3>
<p>DOM is a Document Object Model. It is a tree model of various elements of HTML. 
  In other words, DOM is the nice representation of the entire web page including margin, padding, and content. </p>
<p>DOM is a document which gives access to the webpage of any website and one can manipulate it temporarily. </p>
<p>When DOM is accessed then we can add, delete or create code.</p>



<h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3> 

<p>Functions are backbone of JavaScript. They are a set of statements that performs a task/calculate value. 
  In JS functions are defined by using ‘function’ command.</p> 
       <p>Functions are used to reuse a code. 
         The programmer once defines the code and then that code can be used again with different arguments.</p>
        </p>
        <p>Functions are used to avoid writing same code again and again. </p>

        <h3>How and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h3>
        <p>Google is my first choice as well as relevant documentation such as Git documentation or CSS/HTML References. However, if still in doubt, then I will ask my facilitator and also others learners via slack. 
                I also have help at home and some of my friends are also familiar with the technology. 
                </p>
