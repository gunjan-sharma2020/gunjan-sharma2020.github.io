    <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths</h1>
  
    
    <h3>Core personal values</h3>
    
    <P>Empathy, truth and respect are some of the values very dear to me. These values define me and help me make decisions in my life. Empathy helps me see what others feel and go through in their lives. 
         <p>  I remember when I was working at a school overseas, I was responsible for the money that was 
             collected as a fund and one of my colleagues took a small amount and slipped it under the table. 
             I saw it but didn’t say anything to that person as I didn’t want him to be ashamed or embarrassed 
             in front of other colleagues. However, I managed to put the amount under the table with the rest of 
             the money without confronting or attacking him.</P>
            <p>I believe in ‘action speak louder than words.’ I think my colleague got the message.
            </P>

         <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity</h3>
         <p>Belonging to one of the oldest civilisations, I think my culture has taught me to learn new things and still be connected to our roots. </p>
        
         <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h3>
         <p>My ability to face challenges of my life with a positive attitude, and self-introspection are my strengths. However, I think too much of self-criticism is becomes my weakness.</p>
