    <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
  
    
    <h3>Goals/pathways</h3>
    
    <P>My long-term goal is to be a Business Analyst and the reason I am doing web development 
        is to increase my knowledge in this field. The knowledge I will gain with this course will help me
         have meaningful discussion with the developers about the solutions.</P>

         <h3>Skill Development</h3>
         <p>Public speaking and communication are the two human skills I would like to see develop at EDA. </p>

         <h3>Strengths</h3>
         <p>Friendly, Supportive, Trustworthy, Organised, Diligent and love to learn new things. Commitments means a lot to me. </p>
    
         <h3>Limitations </h3>
<p>Self-critical and very emotional.</p>

<h3>Manage workload </h3> 
<p>The key to manage workload at EDA for me is ‘Time management’. 
    I have school going kids and they are a priority; however, I have family support and I can rely on them.
     Therefore, I believe that I can manage my time and commitments effectively.</p> 
       <p>Another aspect of handling workload is to do activities to destress myself such as breathing exercise or going for a walk. Learning something new is always stressful and challenging for me therefore, I have to destress myself from time to time. 
        </p>

        <h3>How and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h3>
        <p>Google is my first choice as well as relevant documentation such as Git documentation or CSS/HTML References. However, if still in doubt, then I will ask my facilitator and also others learners via slack. 
                I also have help at home and some of my friends are also familiar with the technology. 
                </p>


                <h3>Expectation from the facilitation team</h3> 
                <p>Timely response, availability, guidance </p>
