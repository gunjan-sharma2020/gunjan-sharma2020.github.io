    <h1>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h1>
    <h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Got blocked on a simple problem</li>

      </ul>
    </h3>


    <P>For sprint 4, I was supposed to run small coding tests. While doing the first challenge i.e. Variables and
      Objects I faced my first problem. It was uncomfortable in the beginning to know that I can’t
      solve the problem as it was supposed get difficult at later stage. </P>


    <p>In the morning I asked one of my friends from the cohort and she told me that it is a test problem. After solving
      that problem, I was able to run test without error.
      The one thing that I learned from this was it is better to ask someone from the cohort who in the same boat. </p>

    <p>For this problem I used ‘Asking your peers for help’ technique.</p>


    <h3>Solved a problem in an elegant way.</h3>

    <p>When I forked ‘Super FizzBuzz’ kata, my first reaction was “Oh no!! functions.” Functions are still difficult for
      me.
      I knew it’s going to be challenging and I am going to face problems here. </p>

    <p>I failed the first test. Tried doing it many times but no avail.
      Then I decided going through the FreeCodeCamp material again (not all of it but the one I needed).
      I was able to understand many things that I didn’t the first time.
      However, still I couldn’t pass the test. </p>

    <p>Although a sample solution was given but I didn’t want to look at it as that will help me solve the code but
      I won’t understand. Then I started writing pseudocode (should have done this before).
      Gradually code started making sense and I was able to solve the problem. </p>

    <h3>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem-solving techniques and process:</h3>

    <h4>• Pseudocode</h4>

    <p>Now I can see why writing pseudocode is important. This technique makes coding easy and I use it often.</p>

    <h4>• Rubber ducky method</h4>

    <p>This method looks awkward in the beginning however, it makes sense once I started using it.</p>

    <h4>• Reading error messages</h4>

    <p>I still find this difficult as sometimes it doesn’t make sense as to what the message is saying except the first
      line.</p>

    <h4>• Googling</h4>

    <p>Googling is still the first choice.</p>

    <h4>• Console. Logging</h4>

    <p>Not very confident but slowly getting there.</p>

    <h4>• Asking your peers for help</h4>

    <p>I have used this method the most and I think this is the most helpful for me.</p>

    <h4>• Asking coaches for help</h4>

    <p>This is the last option if the above given options don't work then I have to ask my coaches</p>

    <h4>• Improving your process with reflection</h4>

    <p>Doing reflections help me see what I have done and what I have learned. </p>
