    <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth mindset</h1>
  
    
    <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
    
    <P>It is the ability of the brain to change throughout our life. During this process the brain deletes
         the neural connections that are not necessary or useful and strengths the necessary oneâ€™s. 
         Our brain goes through the changes all the time and these changes can happen slow or fast and can also be positive or negative. </P>
            </P>

            <p>When we learn new pathways are formed in the brain. 
                Learning a language or musical instrument are some of the examples that does 
                neuroplasticity of the brain.</p>

         <h3>Growth mindset</h3>
         <p>Neuroplasticity and growth mindset looks similar but they are not. Growth mindset means that the skills, talents, and abilities can be developed and improved with determination whereas 
             neuroplasticity means that the brain can adopt and develop beyond the usual development period. </p>

             <h3>There are multiple ways through which we can increase our neuroplasticity:</h3>
        
             <ul>
            <li>Traveling</li>
            <li>Intermittent fasting </li>
            <li>Learning new languages </li>
            <li>Learning musical instrument </li>
            <li>Reading fiction</li>
            <li>Dancing </li>
            <li>Increasing vocabulary </li>
        </ul>
