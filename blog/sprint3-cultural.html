    <h1>EQ vs IQ</h1>
  
    
    <h3>IQ (Intelligent quotient) </h3>
    
    <P>IQ is score driven and is designed in a way to access the individual intelligence based on ability to learn, 
        understand and apply information to skills (word comprehension, math skills etc.).</P>
            </P>

         <h3>EQ (Emotional Intelligence)</h3>
         <p>EQ is an individualâ€™s ability to identify, evaluate, control and express emotions. 
             People with high EQ have the ability to connect with others and understand their feelings. </p>
        
         <p>So far IQ has been the only parameter that defined human intelligence. 
             However, now there are two types of emotions i.e. EQ and IQ. </p>
        <p>"A high IQ will get you through school, a high EQ will get you through life." 
            is one of the quotes will stay with me for a long period of time. </p>
